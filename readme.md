## Steps to implement the MockServer

1. Add the mockserver as a development dependency to your project. Thanks to the UI5-Tooling v3 we don't have to add the middleware to the ui5 dependencies anymore

```shell
npm i -D @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver
```

2. Add the configuration for the mockserver to the `ui5.yaml`.

``` yaml
- name: sap-fe-mockserver
  beforeMiddleware: compression
  mountPath: /
  configuration:
    service:
      urlPath: "/path/to/service"
      metadataXmlPath: "./path/to/metadata.xml"
      mockdataRootPath: "./path/to/mockdata"
      generateMockData: true
```

3. Restart the application and check that the mockserver is working.

4. We can enable a `watch` mode which will update the mock- and metadata when it changes

4. To mock an `action` or `functionImport` we can use the `executeAction` hook:

```javascript
    executeAction: async function (actionDefinition, actionData, keys) {
    }
```
